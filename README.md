# MAT2330

This repository contains scripts, notes, and visualizations for **Differential Equations & Linear Algebra**.

**Textbook:** *Differential Equations & Linear Algebra, Second Edition* by Farlow et al.

## Contents

* **PDFs**: Worked solutions, notes, and problem sets exported from LaTeX/LyX.
* **Python Scripts**: Code for solving ODEs and generating plots of solution curves.
* **.tex Files**: Source files for notes and solutions.
* **Images**: Solution curve plots (`.png`) generated from Python.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* SciPy
* LaTeX/LyX (for working with `.tex` files)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Use the Python scripts to solve differential equations and generate solution curve images.
3. Compile `.tex` files into PDFs for formatted notes/solutions.

## Example

```
python solution_curves_plot.py
```

This produces a file named `solution_curves.png` with solution curves for the example differential equation.
